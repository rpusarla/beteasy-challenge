Assumptions/Instructions
========================
1. Two separate classes and methods have been created to fetch the data from XML and JSON files respectively.
2. Unable to write the testcases within 2 hours time.
3. Assumption is that the same format of the files would be uploaded each time. In the real world scenarios, these files would be validated against a schema file such as XSD for XML.
4. Both the XmlData class and JsonData classes have been instantiated from the startup class (Program.cs)
5. There are no external dependencies been used while creating the solution. However, I have searched through the internet to find out the appropriate functions to fetch the XML and JSON data during the course of this exercise.
